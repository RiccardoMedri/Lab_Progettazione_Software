# Modify existing files

Implement the `static` function `it.unibo.io.LineNumbers.addLineNumbersToTextFile(File)`,
which creates a modified version of a `File` with a different name,
in which each line is prefixed by its line number (starting with `1`).

As a reference, look at the test `it.unibo.io.TestLineNumbers` and to the corresponding resources.
Also, notice how the `File` is found from the classpath.
